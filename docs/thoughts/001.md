# 001 Testing shows the presence, not the absence

[Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) once said, {==“Testing shows the presence, not the absence, of bugs.”==} In other words, a program can be proven incorrect by a test, but it cannot be proven correct. All that tests can do, after sufficient testing effort, is allow us to deem a program to be correct enough for our purposes.
