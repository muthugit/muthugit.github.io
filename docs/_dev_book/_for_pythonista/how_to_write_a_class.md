# :pythonista: How to write a class in python?
## Why we need a class instead of a function?
The main difference between a function and a class is that, using classes we can create multiple instances but using function we can run the same function with different parameters.

## Define a class

```python
class YourBusinessLogic:
    def __init__(self):
        """Initializing the class"""
        pass
```

## Methods

```python
def first_logic(self, param1):
    """This is the first business logic created to <purpose>

    :param param1: The parameter to the method
    :type param1: <the data type of the parameter>

    :returns: This function will return the output of the logic
    :rtype: The return type of the function
    """"
    # Your business logic here
    return None
```

```
